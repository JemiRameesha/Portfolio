    <h2>Mini Project</h2>
    <p>The main goal of our project is to reduce wastage of water.Many times we cannot predict the water level in the water tank from outside.This results in wastage of water.By using this project we can detect the water level in the tank
        <li>Water level sensor</li>
        <p>This sensor is a combination of the attached series of ten exposed copper traces. The copper traces are merged with each other in order to have one sense trace between two copper traces.</p>
        <p>This sensor works on the principle of variable resistance. The sensor consists of a series of parallel exposed conductors. Together this series acts as a variable resistor, whose resistance varies according to the water level in the water tank.

            As more water sensor is submerged in, the better is the conductivity and the lower is the resistance. The less the water sensor is submerged in, the poor is the conductivity and the higher is the resistance.
            
            The output of the water level sensor is according to the resistance of the water produced. i.e. it will produce a voltage proportional with resistance.
            
            </p>
        <li>Components Required</li>   
        <ul>1)Water level sensor</ul>
        <ul>2)Arduino Uno</ul>
        <ul>3)Connecting Wires</ul>
        <ul>4)LEDs</ul>
        <ul>5)Resistors</ul>
        <ul>6)Breadboard</ul>
    </p>
    <li>Interfacing</li>
    <p>In this interfacing, connect the signal pin of the sensor to the A0 of the Arduino.
        Connect the VCC of the sensor to the Digital pin 7 of the Arduino.
        Connect GND of the sensor to the Ground of the Arduino.
        Connect the cathode of RED, YELLOW, GREEN LED to the 2,3,4 digital pin of the Arduino respectively.
        Connect all anodes of the LED commonly to the GND pin of the Arduino.</p>
